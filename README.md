# PHP-Projects

Welcome to the **PHP-Projects** repository! This repository contains two web application projects developed during the Computer Science second-year course. Each project focuses on web application development using PHP, JavaScript, and databases like MongoDB and Phaser.js.

## Project 1: Snake-Game

The first project is a web application that combines PHP, JavaScript, and Phaser.js to create a classic Snake game. It also involves database integration for the dynamic "account" page functionality.
